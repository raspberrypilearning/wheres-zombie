## Challenge: Improve the game

Here are some ideas you could explore to improve your zombie game:

+ Add descriptions to each of the markers you create so that the person has some background story about what they have found
+ Add markers that are randomly generated, for example you could set zombies to randomly generate at different locations. You will want to restrict the possible latitudes and longitudes for these markers or you might be generating zombies on another continent - we'll let somebody else worry about those.
+ Randomly delete a marker after a certain amount of time - perhaps a hospital got destroyed or zombies found some of the weapons?
+ Add a more sophisticated scoring system
+ Only reveal one of the markers at a time, revealing the next one when the first is reached, forcing a more 'treasure hunt' style of play
+ Replace all of the marker images with ? icons - then you don't know until you get there if you're finding a juicy weapon store or a den of zombies!
